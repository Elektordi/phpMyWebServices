phpMyWebServices
================

**It is an old project of mine imported from sourceforge. It's only here for historical purposes.**

phpMyWebServices is a framework that can serve dotNET-like PHP Web-services without any external library, so it works on all apache/php servers (MySQL not required).
With it, you can easy host any webservice on the most of free hosting services!
